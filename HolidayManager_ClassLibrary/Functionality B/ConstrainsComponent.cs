            //• At least one manager and one senior staff member must be on duty
            //• At least 60% of a department must be on duty
    //• Peak time balancing
            //• 15th of July to 31st of August
            //• 15th of December to 22nd of December
            //• The week before and after Easter, which changes each year as Easter
            //falls on a different day each year


    //none of these constraints apply
    //between the 23rd of December to the 3rd January of every year.

    //  You should extend the system by including a component which applies
    //  constraint checking.
    //  When an employee submits a holiday request, the system should use the
    //  component to automatically check whether all constraints are satisfied.
    //  The list of outstanding requests shown to the admin user should be split
    //  into two, those which don’t break any of the constraints and those which
    //  do and can't be accepted.
    //  For requests which break constraints, the system should specify which
    //  constraint is being broken. There could be more than one, in which case
    //  they should all be listed.
