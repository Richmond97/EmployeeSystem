    //  You should extend the system by including a component which applies
    //  constraint checking.
    //  When an employee submits a holiday request, the system should use the
    //  component to automatically check whether all constraints are satisfied.
    //  The list of outstanding requests shown to the admin user should be split
    //  into two, those which don’t break any of the constraints and those which
    //  do and can't be accepted.
    //  For requests which break constraints, the system should specify which
    //  constraint is being broken. There could be more than one, in which case
    //  they should all be listed.
