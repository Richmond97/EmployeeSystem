# Employee Holiday booking system

A desktop app- website - mobile app. Website and mobile app are aimed for the employees
while the desktop app is aimed for the admin. Several algorithms were implemented to obtain 
the most efficient system possible, for instance, a prioritisation algorithm based on holidays 
already taken was designed to ease the operation of managing holidays requests, also, requests 
that do not respect predefined constraints will be highlighted to the admin with the constraint 
broken, and many more functionalities.
